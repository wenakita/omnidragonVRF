# Vanity Address Generation Summary

## Overview

We successfully generated vanity addresses for BOTH the OmniDragonHybridRegistry and omniDRAGON token contracts that start with `0x69` and end with `0777`.

## Final Results

### Registry Contract
- **Address**: `0x69637BfD5D2b851D870d9E0E38B5b73FaF950777`
- **Salt**: `0x0888aac688ac4325402d896dc7d5b5510eae7276238830f82ce7df49a57cb3d5`
- **Pattern**: Starts with `0x69`, ends with `0777`
- **Status**: âœ… DEPLOYED on Sonic

### omniDRAGON Token Contract  
- **Address**: `0x69cb0574d4f7ca6879a72cb50123B391c4e60777`
- **Salt**: `0x2cba8e159bea4252994ade12157f7e9324a2d6f6878baa8f0031cb0bd44bfefa`
- **Pattern**: Starts with `0x69`, ends with `0777`
- **Status**: ðŸ”„ Ready for deployment

## Technical Details

### CREATE2 Address Calculation
The CREATE2 address is calculated as:
```
keccak256(0xff ++ factory_address ++ salt ++ init_code_hash)[12:]
```

Where:
- **Factory Address**: `0xAA28020DDA6b954D16208eccF873D79AC6533833`
- **Init Code Hash**: `0x737d24397a729e9302816aff7cdbebd5ba936ba6f9962597055bdb9cfd45c920`
- **Salt**: Found through brute force search

### Generation Process

1. Created a Rust-based vanity address generator using parallel processing
2. Searched approximately 60 million salt values across 28 threads
3. Found the matching address in ~22.5 seconds
4. The generator uses the CREATE2 factory address as the constructor argument

### Important Notes

1. **Constructor Argument**: The registry must be deployed with the CREATE2 factory address as the initial owner (not the deployer address) to match the vanity address calculation.

2. **Ownership Transfer**: After deployment, ownership needs to be transferred from the factory to the actual deployer address.

3. **Consistency**: This vanity address will be the same on all chains (Sonic, Arbitrum, Avalanche) due to CREATE2 deterministic deployment.

## Benefits

- **Memorable**: The address `0x69...0777` is easy to remember
- **Brandable**: The "69" prefix and "777" suffix create a distinctive pattern
- **Verifiable**: Users can easily verify they're interacting with the correct registry
- **Cross-chain Consistency**: Same address on all deployed chains

## Implementation

The deployment script has been updated to:
1. Use the vanity salt when deploying the registry
2. Use the factory address as the constructor argument
3. Transfer ownership from factory to deployer after deployment
