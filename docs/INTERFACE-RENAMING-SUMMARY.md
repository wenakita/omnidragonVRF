# 🔄 Interface Renaming Summary

**Date:** December 18, 2024  
**Purpose:** Improve naming consistency between interfaces and implementations  

---

## 📋 Changes Made

### 1. ✅ **IDragonRevenueDistributor → IDragonFeeManager**

**Old File:** `contracts/interfaces/governance/fees/IDragonRevenueDistributor.sol`  
**New File:** `contracts/interfaces/governance/fees/IDragonFeeManager.sol`

**Rationale:** The implementation contract is called `DragonFeeManager`, so the interface should match this naming convention.

**Changes:**
- ✅ Renamed interface from `IDragonRevenueDistributor` to `IDragonFeeManager`
- ✅ Updated documentation to reflect fee management focus
- ✅ Updated all imports and references in dependent contracts

### 2. ✅ **IveDRAGONFeeDistributor → IveDRAGONRevenueDistributor**

**Old File:** `contracts/interfaces/governance/voting/IveDRAGONFeeDistributor.sol`  
**New File:** `contracts/interfaces/governance/voting/IveDRAGONRevenueDistributor.sol`

**Rationale:** The implementation contract is called `veDRAGONRevenueDistributor`, so the interface should match this naming convention.

**Changes:**
- ✅ Renamed interface from `IveDRAGONFeeDistributor` to `IveDRAGONRevenueDistributor`
- ✅ Updated documentation to reflect revenue distribution focus
- ✅ No imports needed updating (interface was not yet being used)

## 🔧 Files Updated

### Interface Files
- ✅ Created: `contracts/interfaces/governance/fees/IDragonFeeManager.sol`
- ✅ Created: `contracts/interfaces/governance/voting/IveDRAGONRevenueDistributor.sol`
- ✅ Deleted: `contracts/interfaces/governance/fees/IDragonRevenueDistributor.sol`
- ✅ Deleted: `contracts/interfaces/governance/voting/IveDRAGONFeeDistributor.sol`

### Implementation Files
- ✅ `contracts/core/tokens/omniDRAGON.sol` - Updated import and interface reference
- ✅ `contracts/core/governance/voting/veDRAGONRevenueDistributor.sol` - Updated import and interface implementation

---

## 🎯 Benefits

### Improved Consistency
- ✅ Interface names now match their implementation contracts
- ✅ Clear distinction between "fee management" and "revenue distribution"
- ✅ Better developer experience with predictable naming

### Enhanced Clarity
- ✅ `IDragonFeeManager` clearly indicates fee management functionality
- ✅ `IveDRAGONRevenueDistributor` clearly indicates revenue distribution to veDRAGON holders
- ✅ Naming aligns with the actual purpose of each contract

## 🔍 Verification

All references have been updated and verified:

```bash
# Verify no old interface names remain
grep -r "IDragonRevenueDistributor" contracts/ || echo "✅ All references updated"
grep -r "IveDRAGONFeeDistributor" contracts/ || echo "✅ All references updated"

# Verify new interfaces exist
ls contracts/interfaces/governance/fees/IDragonFeeManager.sol
ls contracts/interfaces/governance/voting/IveDRAGONRevenueDistributor.sol
```
