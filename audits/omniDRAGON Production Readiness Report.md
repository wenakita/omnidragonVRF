```
‚úÖ Security audit by reputable firm
‚úÖ Integration testing with existing systems
‚úÖ Partner coordination and communication
‚úÖ Testnet deployment and validation
```

#### Phase 2: Soft Launch (1 week)
```
‚úÖ Mainnet deployment with limited functionality
‚úÖ Small-scale testing with trusted users
‚úÖ Monitor gas usage and performance
‚úÖ Validate all integrations
```

#### Phase 3: Full Migration (2-4 weeks)
```
‚úÖ Enable all features
‚úÖ Migrate user balances (if applicable)
‚úÖ Update all partner integrations
‚úÖ Sunset old contract
```

### **Integration Compatibility Assessment**

#### LayerZero V2 Integration ‚úÖ
- **Status:** Compatible with testing required
- **Action Required:** Test cross-chain transfers with existing Arbitrum consumer
- **Risk Level:** LOW (interface unchanged)

#### VRF System Integration ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Status:** Compatible but requires validation
- **Action Required:** Test with deployed VRF system
- **Risk Level:** MEDIUM (gas limit changes may affect lottery processing)

#### Partner Pool Integration ‚úÖ
- **Status:** Fully backward compatible
- **Action Required:** Update partner contracts to use new address
- **Risk Level:** LOW (interface preserved)
