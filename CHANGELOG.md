- Use identical bytecode for all chains
- Ensure truly universal addresses

### 🧪 Testing
- Successfully extracted Sonic deployment bytecode
- Verified bytecode hash consistency
- Tested address prediction accuracy

### 🔍 Analysis
- Identified Hardhat compilation differences as root cause
- Confirmed gas parameters don't affect CREATE2 addresses
- Documented bytecode hash importance

---

## [1.5.0] - 2025-06-29 - Multi-Chain Deployment Attempts

### 🚀 Deployments
- **Sonic**: Successfully deployed `0x0f0f00280f6632fd0a2ce777e0f456d2e3e46029`
- **Avalanche**: Successfully deployed `0x878150a086D9558437EC7D2bd922E05f2226850f`
- **Arbitrum**: Failed due to insufficient funds

### ❌ Issues Identified
- Different addresses across networks despite CREATE2
- Hardhat compilation differences between network calls
- Bytecode inconsistency causing address variations

### 🔍 Root Cause Analysis
- CREATE2 addresses depend on: factory + salt + bytecode hash
- Hardhat compiles differently for different networks
- Need locked bytecode approach for true universality

---

## [1.0.0] - 2025-06-29 - Initial Universal Deployment Attempt

### 🎯 Goal
- Achieve same omniDRAGON address across all chains
- Current addresses were different:
  - Avalanche: `0x14D44493F6777c2f6accbDDd6936d33437c5e337`
  - Arbitrum: `0x2f8ad1c558C43Fa05F4A43a2C78C595443e4763c`

## [0.9.0] - 2025-06-29 - Address Comparison & Root Cause Analysis

### 🔍 Analysis
- Discovered completely different addresses across chains
- Avalanche omniDRAGON: `0x60E34a8fFc991e3aD7b823c8410d8b52bCbC70b8`
- Sonic omniDRAGON: `0x05F6C2E1B48E9d807377e555b8b91025aAFDB92e`

### 🕵️ Root Cause
- Avalanche used OmniDragonDeployer: `0x775aCdD9234aA8C050E710de8D4A40c4AD8D4bdf`
- Sonic used old version: `0xeaa37dB66b9507C422F137f719874E5884A9d17E`

### 🔧 Fix
- Updated `hardhat.config.ts`
- Changed Sonic gas price: 100 gwei → 55 gwei
- Optimized for network requirements

### 📊 Impact
- Reduced gas costs for Sonic deployments
